> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

> After wrangling, the data to be analysed has 174,881 bike rides with 21 columns, of which 10 columns are numeric, 4 object, 2 datatime and 5 category.

>The duration column has only data of rides that are above 60 seconds.


## Summary of Findings

>This analysis allowed us to take a look at several characteristics of the bike stations and their customers. We saw that:

- there are roughly three regions for both start and end stations. Moreover, we saw that these share the same geo location, therefore, a start location is also an end location;
- the busiest start stations have no high differences between the stations that is only 0.25%;
- the top busiest end station is 0.52% busier than the second busiest end station;
- bike riders that start from the busiest station will end in the top 10 busiest end stations
- bike riders that ended at the busiest end station have not started from the same stations on the top 10 busiest start stations;
- the busiest day of the week is Thursday;
- the busiest parts of a Thursday are mornings and evenings;
- males is the most frequent gender category riding a bike at the San Francisco bike stations representing almost 75% of all the riders. 
- the high ratio of males gender category is kept across all days of the week and all parts of the day.
- customer user type will ride substantially longer than subcriber user type for both start and end stations.
- younger (around 20 years) users will take the longest rides and above 80 years old taking the shortest.
- on weekends are recorded the longest rides for both ages and user types;
- on weekends, younger members tend to ride longer.
